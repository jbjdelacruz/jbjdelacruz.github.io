This project—which earned first place in a [24-hour DataCamp challenge](https://www.datacamp.com/competitions/childrens-motor-performance?entry=7b91f332-e08a-41a0-9db4-a1c5c1ac5e28)—investigates how the Motor Performance Index (MPI), based on four essential motor skills (power, speed, flexibility, and coordination), relates to children’s attributes such as age, gender, weight, and height. Through multiple linear regression, it identifies the most significant predictors of motor performance, offering valuable insights for early sports talent identification.
