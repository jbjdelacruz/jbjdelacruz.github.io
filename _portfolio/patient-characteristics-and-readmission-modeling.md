This report analyzes ten years of hospital data (n ≈ 25,000) from 130 US hospitals to identify high-risk groups for readmission. Using multivariate logistic regression, it measures the effects of variables such as age, diabetes diagnosis or medication, and length of stay on patient readmission, supporting targeted follow-up care after discharge.
