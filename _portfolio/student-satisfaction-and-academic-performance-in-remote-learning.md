This report analyzes the remote learning experiences of University of the Philippines students using survey-scale data collected more than a year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It examines respondent demographics, summarizes satisfaction and academic performance scale ratings, and explores the correlations among scale items. The findings highlight patterns that can inform strategies for enhancing online instruction.
